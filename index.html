<h1>Privacy Policy – Monk Mode</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 18 January 2026</p>

<p>
    Monk Mode is a productivity and focus application developed by Abhik Chakraborty.
    This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the app.
</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>
    Monk Mode does <strong>not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal or sensitive user data</strong>
    with the developer or any third-party servers.
</p>
<p>
    The app stores limited data <strong>locally on the user’s device only</strong> to enable core functionality,
    including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Focus session state, timers, and duration</li>
    <li>User-selected focus modes and preferences</li>
    <li>Focus statistics and progress data</li>
</ul>
<p>
    All such data remains strictly within the device’s internal storage and never leaves the device.
</p>

<h2>Internet Usage</h2>
<p>
    Monk Mode may access the internet <strong>only when the user explicitly uses the in-app minimal browser</strong>
    for utility or study-related surfing during an active focus session.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>No browsing history is tracked or logged by the app</li>
    <li>No visited URLs are stored by the developer</li>
    <li>No browsing data is transmitted externally</li>
</ul>

<h2>Permissions and Their Purpose</h2>

<h3>Accessibility Service</h3>
<p>
    Accessibility permission is used solely to enforce focus restrictions, block distracting apps,
    detect foreground application changes, and ensure uninterrupted focus sessions.
    Data accessed through this permission is processed locally and never transmitted or stored externally.
</p>

<h3>Usage Access (App Usage Statistics)</h3>
<p>
    Usage access is required to monitor app usage patterns during focus sessions and to provide
    digital wellbeing insights. All usage data remains on the device and is not shared externally.
</p>

<h3>Notification Permission (Optional)</h3>
<p>
    Notification permission is used to display focus timers, session alerts, and important focus-related
    reminders. Notification data is not collected or transmitted.
</p>

<h3>Do Not Disturb (DND) Access</h3>
<p>
    Monk Mode may request Do Not Disturb (DND) access to temporarily control notification interruptions
    during active focus sessions.
</p>
<p>
    DND access is used only to enable or disable system-level notification suppression based on
    user-selected focus rules. The app does not read, collect, store, or transmit notification content,
    call logs, or message data when using this permission.
</p>

<h3>Make and Manage Phone Calls</h3>
<p>
    Phone call permission is used to manage and handle incoming or outgoing calls during active focus
    sessions, such as allowing controlled call handling or enforcing focus rules.
    Call data is not recorded, stored, or shared.
</p>

<h3>All Files Access (Optional)</h3>
<p>
    File access permission is used exclusively to allow users to open and view document files
    (such as PDFs or study materials) through the app’s inbuilt document viewer during focus sessions.
    <strong>The app accesses only files explicitly selected by the user and does not scan, monitor, index,
    upload, or share any files.</strong>
    All document processing occurs locally on the device.
</p>

<h3>Foreground Service (Special Use Permission)</h3>
<p>
    Monk Mode uses a foreground service for special use cases to ensure uninterrupted operation
    of active focus sessions, timers, and focus enforcement features.
</p>
<p>
    The foreground service runs only while a focus session is active and displays a persistent
    notification to inform the user that the service is running.
    This service does not collect, transmit, or share any personal or sensitive data and operates
    entirely on the device.
</p>

<h3>Battery Optimization Exemption</h3>
<p>
    Battery optimization exemption is requested to ensure reliable background operation,
    accurate focus timers, and uninterrupted focus enforcement.
    This permission does not involve any data collection.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
    Monk Mode does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising networks,
    or data-collection SDKs.
</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>
    All locally stored data is protected by Android’s built-in security mechanisms.
    Since no personal data is transmitted externally, the risk of data exposure is minimal.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be published at this same URL.
</p>
